First Lecture: 
Implemented the mandelbrot
I accidently made my first implementation using numpy to generate the matrix

Second Lecture:
During this lecture we spent time going through using numpy for optimisation.
I spent most of the time during this class trying to figure out, what was wrong with my code.
Since i knew i already used numpy - but i still got very slow results.
Found the issue, i was making a matrix which was about 3 times bigger that what i was trying to make. 
Got a speed up of about 2.7X

Third Lecture:
Code omtimisation and profiling
Now we are looking at futher optimisation (numba)

Understanding the algorithmic intensisty, we can figure out what we need to focus on when optimising
< 1 FLOPs/byte = Memory-bound (Numpy will help here)
1-10 FLOPs/byte = Balanced (Both cache optimisation and compute optimisations will help here)
> 10 FLOPs/byte = Compute-bound (Numba or JIT will help here)
